    <h1>Rules and Information</h1>

    <p>
      Some key points to keep in mind when renting from <strong>Los Santos Organisation (LSO)</strong>!<br>
      We are <strong>not responsible</strong> for any missed payments in which you could lose valuables stored on our properties.
      At the time of purchasing, your salesperson should go over in detail how to pay the weekly rent and that multiple weeks can be paid at once.
      We also provide access level details:
    </p>

    <h2>Access Levels:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Access to the property and garage, but <strong>not the storage</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Access to the property, garage, <strong>including storage</strong> and <code>/furniture</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Same as Level 2, plus ability to <strong>pay rent through <code>/comp</code></strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>❗ Important:</strong> If you don’t pay rent for your property, we may <strong>not be able to recover your items</strong> unless you reach out in a timely manner.
      All properties should be <strong>clean and empty</strong>. If you find any left items, <strong>report it to LSO</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      An LSO employee may contact you <strong>before eviction</strong>, but will not hold the property for more than <strong>2–3 days</strong>. You must pay to retrieve your property.
      Properties no longer auto fall-off. We may not contact you if Discord info is unavailable.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <strong>LSO owns your home</strong>, we are entitled to be on the property. Our rent is low compared to others, considering the location and quality. We have properties in top city spots.
